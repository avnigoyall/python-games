This repository contains a collection of simple, interactive Python games, including a guessing game, coin toss, and rock paper scissors.

# Guessing Game
This game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20 within a limited number of attempts. The program will tell the player if they need to guess higher or lower.

# Coin Toss
A coin is randomly tossed and you predict whether the outcome will be heads or tails. Test your luck and see how well you can guess!
